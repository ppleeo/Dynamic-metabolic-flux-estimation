Notes about the video

The first line:
Dynamic extracellular glucose (ec_GLC) concentration and metabolitesâ€™ concentration in
central carbon metabolic pathway of Aspergillus Niger during single (SA) and periodic (PA)
glucose pulses and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae during periodic (PS) glucose pulses (400
s).
The metabolites in gray letters represent unmeasured concentrations.
The unit of ec_GLC concentration was 30umol/L, and it of other metabolites was umol/L.

The second line:
Dynamic fluxes in central carbon metabolic pathway of A. niger during single (SA) and
periodic (PA) glucose pulses and S. cerevisiae during periodic (PS) glucose pulses (400
s).
The unit of fluxes was mmol/g/h.
